"""
3 -> 2 -> 0 -> -4
   -4->2
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed)

1->2
2->1 
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

Constraints:

The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4].
-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
