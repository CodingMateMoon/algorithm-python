    n == nums.length

    Input: nums = [7,4,3,9,1,8,5,2,6], k = 3
Output: [-1,-1,-1,5,4,4,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation:
    - avg[0], avg[1], and avg[2] are -1 because there are less than k elements before each index.
    - The sum of the subarray centered at index 3 with radius 3 is: 7 + 4 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 = 37.
      Using integer division, avg[3] = 37 / 7 = 5.
    - For the subarray centered at index 4, avg[4] = (4 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 + 2) / 7 = 4.
    - For the subarray centered at index 5, avg[5] = (3 + 9 + 1 + 8 + 5 + 2 + 6) / 7 = 4.
    - avg[6], avg[7], and avg[8] are -1 because there are less than k elements after each index.
